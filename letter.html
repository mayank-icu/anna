            I’ll send my ideas here then! But before that, I have to say, I totally get why you sleep early. Honestly, getting a full 8 hours is probably the best thing you can do for yourself. 
            I don’t sleep that early though, I usually stay up pretty late, sometimes working on projects or just listening to music. But I do feel the lack of sleep the next day, so maybe you’re the smart one here.

            Your new book sounds really interesting. <b>Obsession</b> can be such a heavy topic, and if the main character’s mental state is concerning already, I wonder how intense it will get later. 
            Let me know how you feel about it as you go!

        <p><b>Now, about your bakery business, I have some basic ideas that might help. We can discuss them in detail on Slowly, but for now, here are a few things to think about:</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Pre-orders for Custom Cakes</b> – Since you already got an order, you could offer pre-orders for special cakes like birthday cakes or themed cakes. Maybe set up an Instagram highlight with available designs or custom options?</li>
            <li><b>Limited-Time Specials</b> – Seasonal or monthly special items could make your bakery stand out. For example, special spring flavors, or unique holiday treats. It could attract more customers who are curious to try something new.</li>
            <li><b>Collabs with Local Cafés or Events</b> – If there are any small cafés or local events nearby, maybe you could partner with them and supply baked goods? It’s a great way to get your name out there.</li>
            <li><b>Behind-the-Scenes Content</b> – People love seeing the process behind making things, especially beautifully decorated cakes. Short Instagram reels or posts showing how you bake and decorate could get more engagement.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These are just a few starting ideas. We can discuss more details on Slowly if you’re interested. Let me know what you think!</p>

        <p class="signature">Take care, <br> Mayank</p>
